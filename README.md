👋 Hey, I’m Hassan!

🚀 Software Engineer | Full‑Stack Developer | Systems Thinker

💡 Strengths  
Problem Solving • Clean Architecture • UI/UX Awareness • Resilience • Continuous Learning • Attention to Detail • Systems Thinking

🏆 Recent Accomplishment  
Completed TripleTen’s Software Engineering Bootcamp (Certificate), building production‑style full‑stack applications using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

🔎 What Drives Me  
I love creating intuitive, reliable applications that solve real problems. Whether I’m refining state management, optimizing backend validation, or polishing UI details, I’m always looking for ways to make the experience smoother and the codebase cleaner.

⚡ Fun Fact  
I used to think every feature needed to be perfect before committing it to Git… now I commit early, often, and with intention.

💻 Why Software Engineering?
Software engineering is the perfect intersection of creativity, logic, and real‑world impact. I’ve always been drawn to technology, but everything clicked the moment I wrote my first “HELLO WORLD.” That tiny line of code opened up an entire universe of possibility — and I’ve been hooked ever since.

📈 Looking Ahead  
I’m excited to join a team where I can contribute to meaningful products, grow as a developer, and continue building scalable, user‑focused applications.
